# London-Underground-Tube-Fastest-Route
Python simulation of the London Underground network that finds the fastest route between stations using weighted graph algorithms. Includes dynamic connections and optimization for travel time and network efficiency.


-------------------------------
**🧭 Overview**

This project simulates the London Underground network and calculates the fastest route between stations using graph theory and pathfinding algorithms. Each station is represented as a node, and connections are weighted by travel time. The model includes a probability-based system for adding random connections to simulate real-world dynamic routes and delays.
